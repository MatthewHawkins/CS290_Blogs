    <div class = "heading"><h2>Challenges</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">This week's assignment ended up being relatively difficult for me for a few reasons. First, I found that some of the CSS that I was
        trying to apply didn't work in the way I expected. I found myself spending a lot of time looking up various problems that I was enountering
        on Google, and simply trial and error style solution hunting until I found something that worked. I think I'll need to try doing some CSS with
        a simpler HTML file, or one that I create in order to get a better grasp on the topic.
    </div>
    <div class = "heading"><h2>What I Learned</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">To be perfectly honest, in this assignment, I learned that I don't have a natural talent for CSS :) I did get a relatively decent grasp on how
        modify various class elements, and especially got used to margins, borders, and padding. The flexboxes challenged me, and justifying content within the
        boxes, as well as on the site as a whole, was the most difficult part.</p></div>
    <div class = "heading"><h2>Resources I Used</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">I used a lot of Google and Stack Overflow for this project. However, I did also use the class Piazza page which was helpful (shout out to
        Julian and Cooper for their help). I also refered to the class notes that are listed on the course website. This had some info that I used towards the beginning
        of the assignment that helped remind me of the various tools at my disposal. Overall, I'd say Googling questions about justifying items and Piazza were the most helpful.

    <div class = "heading"><h2>Things I Googled</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">The first thing I had to Google was how to properly use flexboxes. I was unsure of their use, and found an <a href = https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox> excellent resource</a>
        that helped me figure out what keywords to use when I was attempting to fix issues. The second thing I spent a lot of time googling was how to size images correctly. I found a lot of advice saying
        that max-height and max-width were both good resources, but didn't know that I could enter a pixel value instead of a percentage value. For some reason, the percentage values were not working on every image
        correctly. I eventually was helped on Piazza with this issue.
