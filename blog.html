    <h2>Code Blog 1</h2>
    <p>This first assignment was a great introduction to getting used to HTML tags. Having played around with them a little bit beforehand, I had little trouble completing this assignment.</p>
    <p>I learned quite a bit in lecture that I was able to implement in the assignment, namely:
        <ul>
            <li>h1 - h6 tags are not used simply for size, but to help divide up different heading sections</li>
            <li>How to link both locally and non-locally hosted images</li>
            <li>More familiarity with the paragraph tag instead of the div tag</li>
        </ul>
        While I knew a lot of the functionality of these tags going in, this was an excellent refresher.
    </p>
    <p>I used a few different resources to help me in this assignment. Most of them were either notes provided by Dr. Hess, or articles online: 
        <ul>
            <li><a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RB_zhgQNrXyWiLBS7YQHMM3pTckI0lssYjkq2D5Sag8/edit">Dr. Hess's Google Doc with HTML notes</a></li>
            <li><a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">An article that discusses image tags in HTML</a></li>
            <li><a href = "https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/">A git handbook to help remind me of the commands we needed to use</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p> 
    <p>I'm looking forward to expanding on this knowledge in the next assignment, and re-learning how to implement CSS to style our pages!</p>
