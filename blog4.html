    <div class = "heading"><h2>Challenges</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">This week was another enjoyable week for sure. THANK YOU SO MUCH for your lectures on handlebars. They were incredibly helpful, and make this assignment much less confusing than it could
        have been. I did have a slight challenge getting a single post to show up, as I was trying to pass an object that had each of the objects needed for my post partial to render. This wasn't working, so I
        created 5 objects, all of which got their data from the postData from the JSON file. Other than that, I got the help I needed accessing the object from your office hours!
    </div>
    <div class = "heading"><h2>What I Learned</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">This topic seemed really quite powerful. I'd say i have a much better understanding of JS objects, third party tools, express, handlebars, etc. I have been trying to figure out a project
        to do over the winter break, and I really want to use these tools for it, which I'm very excited about!
    </p></div>
    <div class = "heading"><h2>Resources I Used</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">Your lectures about handlebars were absolutely fantastic, and nearly all of the material I needed. I think I used GeeksforGeeks once or twice for a few helper functions, and looked at 
        the handlebars site for documentation on helpers, but other than that, I stuck exclusively to your lectures (which is a testament to their thoroughness!).
    </div>
    <div class = "heading"><h2>Things I Googled</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">I google some of the handlebars functionality, and I also looked up a way to see if an index in an array was full (for the single post page section). Other than that, your lectures
        reigned supreme!
    </div>
    <div class = "heading"><h2>THANK YOU!</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">I want to thank you so much for the care you put into these classes! I'm sure for every lecture/assignment we got, there were hours of prep and effort put into them. I feel like
        I learned a ton this term, both in 261 and here in 290. As I look back at this code, and the project we built, I can't help but be amazed by how much we covered. Thank you again so very much for
        the classes. I hope to come take some of your 400 level classes in the spring/next year. Have a fantastic break, stay healthy, and hopefully see you in future classes!
