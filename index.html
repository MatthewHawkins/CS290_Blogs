    <h1>Matthew Hawkins - Assignment 1 Page</h1> <!-- Probably should change this -->
    <p>Hi there! Here's a quick rundown on me: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is Matthew Hawkins - I go by Matthew, Matt, Hawkins, Matty - whatever comes to mind first.</li>
        <li>My OSU email is hawkinma@oregonstate.edu.</li>
        <li>I'm a CS major in my fifth year - don't change majors four times if you don't want to do a victory lap or two.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm coming into this class with relatively little web dev experience. I started an EdX class done by the CE department at Harvard over the summer that focused on web dev using Python, JS, and HTML/CSS, but didn't get too terribly far.<br> The class used a few large Python libraries, which, while exciting, was also difficult without having people to ask questions to.</p>
    <p>Web dev has always seemed like a fun way to utilize CS, and as such, I would like to get the experience to make a functional, visually appealing web page from this class. I am part of a couple student groups on campus, one of which doesn't have a website. <br> I would love to use the things I learn in this class to create on for this group.</p>
    <p>I'm all signed up on Piazza!</p>
    <p>One of the most interesting facts about me is that I've traveled to over 15 countries! Before COVID, my sister and I took six months and traveled a decent chunk of Europe. Definitely an experience I'd recommend to anyone with the travel bug!<br> Here's a picture of me stuffing face in Venice: <br><br><img src = "02.jpg" alt = "Matthew stuffing face with pasta" width = "384" hright = "480"></p>
