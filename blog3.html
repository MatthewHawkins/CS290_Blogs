    <div class = "heading"><h2>Challenges</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">I very much enjoyed this week's assignment. I think JavaScript is an awesome language (almost like Python and C++ had a lovechild). I found it relatively intuitive and forgiving,
        am looking forward to continuing to use it. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to apply the text filter - for some reason, I had a very hard time with this. Finally, deciding to create two
        arrays and then only remove an element if you hit the end of the array without finding the word seemed to be my best option. Still, other than that, the rest of it (after looking some functionality up)
        was fairly straightforward and enjoyable.

    <div class = "heading"><h2>What I Learned</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">I learned everything I now know about JS in this assignment! I learned how important it is to be deliberate with your HTML code (I can see how poot HTML would make JS a royal pain)
        and how to manipulate the DOM using various JS functionality. Additionally, I learned how to make a page dynamic and responsive, and not just a glorified slideshow. I can now also see the importance
        of learning how to manipulate data so that you can compare it to values already present (like we had to do with the filters).

    <div class = "heading"><h2>Resources I Used</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">I used a lot of Google for this project, as well as the class website notes. I also found <a href = https://www.w3schools.com> w3schools.com</a> to be an excellent resource that helped
        with some of the functions I needed (such as string to int, how to separate by whitespace, etc). I used some Stack Overflow as well, but overall, the class notes and w3schools were my most-used resources.
        To give you an idea of this, here's a peak at all the tabs I had open just for the filter section:

    <div class = "heading"><h2>Things I Googled</h2></div>
    <div class = "entry">As far as Googling went this time, I think I mainly used it for various functions to allow me to get at different DOM elements, find built-in JS functions to manipulate text or data,
        and other various misc things. Most of the things I needed to find were included in the class notes, though. I found myself googling a lot trying to figure out how to properly apply the text filter, and
        when working on the checkbox section of the "add post" section. Thankfully, I didn't have to rely on Google to do any heavy learning, and mainly used it for small details.
